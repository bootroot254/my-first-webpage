  <h1>i tried so hard ama kitu</h1>
  <p>today i am going to learn a few things on HTML. but before then i need to start by listing items that am supposed to learn. for example listing them without using numbers but only bulets, this is how its done. sorry if you cant see this.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>And many more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I can also list items while numbering them but by using a different code, for exaple this are the names of my MOFO'S</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ichi</li>
    <li>Evi</li>
    <li>Rezin</li>
    <li>Humphrey</li>
    <li>Jabin</li>
  </ol>
