  <h1>I tried so hard ama kitu</h1>
  <p>Today i am going to learn a few things on HTML. but before then i need to start by listing items that am supposed to learn. for example <em>listing them without using numbers but only bulets, this is how its done.</em> sorry if you cant see this. Oooh!! and Fuck you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>And many more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I can also list items while numbering them but by using a different code, for exaple this are the names of my MOFO'S</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Ichi</strong></li>
    <li>Evi</li>
    <li>Rezin</li>
    <li>Humphrey</li>
    <li>Jabin</li>
  </ol>
